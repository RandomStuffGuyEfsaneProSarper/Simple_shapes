# Simple_shapes

square shape function : square(size,x,y) size changes it's size basically, x is the x coordinate, y is the y coordinate 

square shape but you can choose the color function : squareColor(size,x,y,color1,color2) size changes it's size basically, x is the x coordinate, y is the y coordinate, color1 is the outline, color2 is the inside.

triangle shape function : triangle(size,x,y) size changes it's size basically, x is the x coordinate, y is the y coordinate

triangle shape but you can choose the color function : triangle Color(size,x,y,color1,color2) size changes it's size basically, x is the x coordinate, y is the y coordinate, color1 is the outline, color2 is the inside.

rectangle shape function : rectangle(length,width,x,y) length is it's length, width is it's width, x is the x coordinate, y is the y coordinate. To make the rectangle be downwards instead of upwards, make the width bigger than the length

rectangle shape but you can choose the color function : rectangleColor(length,width,x,y,color1,color2) length is it's length, width is it's width, x is the x coordinate, y is the y coordinate, color1 is the outline, color2 is the inside. To make the rectangle be downwards instead of upwards, make the width bigger than the length.

poligon shape version : poligon(size,corners,x,y)  size changes it's size basically, corners is the amount of corners of the poligon, x is the x coordinate, y is the y coordinate.

poligon shape but you can choose the color function : poligonColor(size,corners,x,y)  size changes it's size basically, corners is the amount of corners of the poligon, x is the x coordinate, y is the y coordinate, color1 is the outline, color2 is the inside.

star shape function : star(size,x,y) size changes it's size basically, x is the x coordinate, y is the y coordinate

star shape but you can choose the color function : starColor(size,x,y,color1,color2,backgroundColor) size changes it's size basically, x is the x coordinate, y is the y coordinate, color1 is the outline, color2 is the inside

crescent shape function which you have to put the colors in : crescent(size,x,y,color1,color2,backgroundColor) size is the size, x is the x coordinate, y is the y coordinate, color1 is the outline, color2 is the color of the inside, choose the backgroundColor as the color that your background will be. Note: U cannot choose the size above 150 or lower than 25.

background color choose function : background(backgroundColor) type the color you want for the backgroundColor. Note: this takes a little too long sorry am so noob at this ;(

P.S.: While writing the colors, don't directly write like the color red, put ' around it or else it won't work. Example: red❌ 'red'✅
and also, sorry for this being bad, because am still learning Python.
